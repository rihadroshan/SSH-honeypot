**SSH honeypot** logs authentication attempts and command executions, providing insights into potential malicious activities.

## **Features**

- **Log SSH connection attempts**: Captures IP addresses, usernames, and passwords used in authentication attempts.
- **Interactive shell simulation**: Provides a realistic shell environment to interact with attackers.
- **Command logging**: Logs all commands executed by the attacker.
- **Customizable authentication**: Allows setting a custom username and password for authentication.
- **Rotating log files**: Logs are stored in rotating files to prevent excessive disk usage.

## **Installation**

1. **Clone this repository**:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rihadroshan/ssh-honeypot.git
   cd ssh-honeypot
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
---
   
## **Basic Usage**

By default, the honeypot will use the username `root`, no password, and bind to the machine's default IP address.

```bash
python3 server.py -p <port>
```

## Usage with Custom Authentication

You can specify a custom username and password for authentication. The `-a` (or `--address`) argument is optional and defaults to the machine's IP address if not provided.

```bash
python3 server.py -p <port> -u <username> -d <password>
```

To bind to a specific IP address, use the `-a` argument:

```bash
python3 server.py -a <IP address> -p <port> -u <username> -d <password>
```
---

## Examples

### Basic Usage
```bash
python3 server.py -p 2222
```
```bash
sudo python3 server.py -p 22
```

### Usage with Custom Authentication
```bash
python3 server.py -p 2222 -u ubuntu -d pass

sudo python3 server.py -p 22 -u ubuntu -d pass
```

### Binding to a Specific IP Address
```bash
python3 server.py -a 192.168.1.100 -p 2222

sudo python3 server.py -a 192.168.1.100 -p 22
```

## Logs

The honeypot logs activities in three rotating log files:

1. **`ssh_sys.log`**: General log file for server activities.
2. **`command_log.log`**: Logs all commands executed by the attacker.
3. **`auth.log`**: Logs authentication attempts, including usernames and passwords.

Log files are rotated when they reach 2000 bytes, with up to 5 backup files retained.
